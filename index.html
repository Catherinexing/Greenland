      <p>
        <span class="start-text">This past summer</b> </span>, as meltwater streamed off the Greenland Ice Sheet in record amounts, the Adolf Jensen, a ramshackle research ship, sat idling here, icebergs near its bow and a mystery below it. Two
        years earlier, a small team of oceanographers had moored a sensor in this fjord’s depths to decipher how warm Atlantic waters are eroding the Helheim Glacier, one of the ice sheet’s largest tongues. But now they couldn’t retrieve the
        500-meter-deep mooring--or its crucial data.</p>
      <p>On deck, under a late July sun, Fiammetta Straneo, a physical oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, glared at a yellow box at her feet. It was blasting acoustic chatter at her mooring, telling a
        latch to let go, but the signal seemed to be falling on deaf ears. “Time to come home,” she said hopefully. The minutes ticked by and the mooring didn’t surface. Straneo grimaced. Over the past decade, she had used moorings like this to
        collect a long-term record of water masses and currents in Sermilik Fjord, a 90-kilometer-long passage, wider than the Mississippi, that ushers melting icebergs from Helheim out to sea and warm water back in. The stuck mooring threatened to
        leave a gap.</p>
      <p>It was an inauspicious start to an ambitious project. Even after decades of study, researchers can’t say how quickly the Greenland Ice Sheet will melt under the strain of human-driven global warming. Melt from Greenland already accounts
        for 25% of global sea level rise, double the contribution of Antarctica, and its share is growing. Rising waters are already exacerbating storm surge and causing sunny-day flooding in cities worldwide. Even by conservative estimates,
        Greenland could contribute another quarter meter of sea level rise by 2100 — within the lifetime of children living today. All told, the ice sheet holds enough water to raise seas by 7 meters—and no one knows whether, or how fast, that
        water will be unleashed.</p>
      <p>As befits its mythical name, the domain of the Norse god of the dead, Helheim is truly an arbiter of Greenland’s fate. The glacier is one of the ice sheet’s primary drains, sliding into the sea at 8 kilometers a year and accounting for 4%
        of the ice sheet’s annual mass loss. Its towering front, as tall as the Statue of Liberty, measures 6 kilometers across. Sea ice shed from the glacier chokes the fjord for tens of kilometers. The glacier’s terminus has behaved erratically
        over the past 15 years, first retreating by 5 kilometers from 2002 to 2005, then advancing and stabilizing for nearly a decade. Then, in 2014, a more severe retreat began, sending the terminus a kilometer beyond its previous low. At the
        same time the glacier has thinned by more than 100 meters CK, leaving a tell-tale “bathtub ring” high on the rock around the fjord.</p>
      <p>Some two-thirds of Greenland’s ice loss happens this way, not as meltwater but as chunks of ice that calve from its 300 outlet glaciers—fast-moving rivers of ice that end in long fjords. These narrow channels, which run hundreds of meters
        deep, “are the bottlenecks,” says Straneo. They are also a fateful meeting place, where a glacier’s calving front encounters currents of increasingly warm ocean water. “These tiny systems are the connection between the ice sheet and the
        ocean,” Straneo says.</p>
      <p>Straneo’s past work has shown that warm Atlantic water is penetrating Sermilik Fjord, which researchers once thought was dominated by waters from the Arctic. Here, it mixes with cold meltwater draining out through channels beneath the ice.
        Straneo believes the emerging freshwater, buoyant because of its low salinity, mixes with the warm water and forms a plume that wells up against the glacier’s front, causing more melting and fracturing. It’s like the ice in your glass of
        whisky, Straneo said. “If you just put it in and don't stir, it lasts a long time. If you stir it, it melts really quickly.”</p>
      <p class="p-short-spacing">To test the idea, she and her colleagues need to breach Helheim’s protective veil of sea ice to observe the warm plume directly. They must also track the behavior of the glacier itself.</p>

      <p>The effort began this year: a four-year, $6 million project financed by the Heising-Simons Foundation, a philanthropy in Los Altos, California. The project, modest in cost by Arctic standards, is attacking Helheim from every angle: Drilling
        into firn—snow that has not yet compacted into ice—to gauge how much water southeastern Greenland’s famously severe storms add to Helheim. Placing seismometers at the glacier’s terminus to sense the spread of hidden fractures. Recording the
        glacier’s calving four times a day with a pair of autonomous lasers dubbed Atlas. Air-dropping hardened drifters that can capture conditions near the glacier front while surviving encounters with icebergs. Placing moorings up and down the
        fjord to probe its depths. And knitting all these observations together with advanced models of glacial fracturing.</p>
      <p>Beyond Helheim, what Straneo and her peers find could feed into something grander: an international long-term observing system that can monitor and assess the risks posed by the melting of Greenland’s most prominent glaciers. That could
        dispel much of the uncertainty about Greenland’s role in future sea level rise.</p>
      <p>As the team arrived in Greenland in late July, they had a reminder of the urgency. A heatwave in Europe was forecast to reach them soon, causing melt unseen since 2012. And Straneo had heard that something phenomenal was happening up at
        Helheim’s front. A surge of meltwater was pouring out at the bedrock, pushing open a 500-meter-wide half-moon of water—a so-called polynya--in the shadow of the glacier’s towering face. It created a direct line to sampling the waters below.
        Such upwellings typically last just a day or two. This one’s size suggested it might last weeks. </p>
      <p>Straneo started her life far from ice. Like many smart students in Italy, she was directed into physics. But she loved to sail and found herself drawn to the ocean and its large-scale currents, first as a modeler and then as a field
        scientist. She spent much of her academic life at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachussett, and it was there, some 15 years ago, that she met Gordon Hamilton, a glaciologist at the University of Maine in Orono.</p>
      <p>At the time, Hamilton and his student, Leigh Stearns, had begun placing GPS units on Helheim to track its movement. Helheim was a scientific backwater; it does not have the easy logistics provided by the National Science Foundation for
        researchers working on Greenland’s western coast, and frequent North Atlantic storms blanket it in snow, making it harder to study than the glittering flat ice of the west.</p>
      <p>While Straneo had been focused on ocean currents, like the “conveyor belt” that influences climate around the North Atlantic, Hamilton convinced her that the smaller-scale currents found in fjords could be key to an equally important
        process: Greenland’s ice loss. In 2008 she and colleagues including Hamilton spent a season in Sermilik. They hired a small boat and dropped temperature and salinity sensors into the fjord on a fishing line, anchoring their moorings with
        cinder blocks. </p>

      <p>It was clear from those first casts that something unexpected was going on. Scientists has once thought the fjord would be filled with water that flows down from the Arctic, hugging Greenland’s coast. But the measurements pointed to two
        layers of warm water in its depths: a deeper layer that seemed to be heading up toward Helheim, and a shallower one, cooler and less salty, heading back to sea. The deep flow was likely Atlantic water, ushered in by summer winds. The
        shallower flow seemed to originate as the warm water interacted with the ice, losing heat and salt in the process. </p>
      <p>Year by year, Straneo kept returning to the fjord. Meanwhile, Hamilton’s frustration with the limited data from the GPS units grew until he met David Finnegan, a remote sensing scientist at the U.S. Army’s Cold Regions Research and
        Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) in Hanover, New Hampshire, who specializes in using reflected laser light to map terrain. What if they used such a laser to constantly monitor Helheim’s front? Tying together such fracturing with the influx of
        Atlantic water could help them figure out what role, if any, the water was playing in the loss of ice. </p>
      <p>In 2012, Finnegan’s team perched a prototype autonomous laser scanner on one of the fjord’s walls, overlooking Helheim’s terminus. It played a beam of infrared light across the glacier, its front, and the sea ice, tracking the calving
        process iceberg by iceberg. The data dropped jaws when Hamilton CK presented them at a meeting in 2013. This was Big Data come to glaciology, each reflected point tied to coordinates in space—as if the team suddenly had a billion GPS units on
        the glacier at once.</p>
      <p>Even with these two complementary lines of evidence, Helheim’s ice loss defied explanation. “Each year was kind of different,” Stearns said. Figure out a mechanism for one month and the year later it was irrelevant. Too many variables, such
        as the flow of meltwater under the glacier and the temperatures beneath the sea ice, could not be tied down. Only a sustained monitoring system, targeting every element of the glacier and fjord, could show how the system delivered ice from
        the glacier to the ocean, and how a warming climate might influence it.</p>
      <p>That vision took a step toward reality just after Hamilton’s talk, when Cyndi Atherton approached him. Atherton, who had joined Heising-Simons to direct their scientific grants, wanted to fund research that could make a room gasp. “What
        would you do with a blank check?” she asked. Heising-Simons began financing the development of the Atlas scanners which could, from perches on both walls of the fjord, capture the entirety of Helheim’s crumbling tongue. </p>

      <p>Three years into the work tragedy struck: Hamilton died in 2016, at 50 years old, after his snowmobile fell 30 meters into an Antarctic crevasse. Those left behind hardened their desire to understand Helheim. Last year, Heising-Simons asked
        Straneo and Stearns to put together a team that would tie down all of Helheim’s variables at once. The project would be a proof of principle, Atherton said, “that will allow other governments to say this is valuable, and we’re going to extend
        from this site to other sites.” </p>
      <p>The work began this past summer.</p>
      <p>The 39-meter-long Jensen, a former Danish fisheries research ship and icebreaker, is far removed from large modern oceanographic ships, where scientists rarely get to touch an instrument. Its crew of five Greenlanders keep it running with a
        mix of grease, tobacco, and gumption. The scientists, too, have to improvise around limitations like the Jensen’s 1960s-vintage winch. When the team retrieves their carousel, a gray cylindrical frame outfitted with sensors and large sampling
        bottles, the winch is too feeble to hoist it on deck. That means an awkward transfer to the ship’s crane.</p>
      <p>It’s just how the modest Straneo — who’s had the same blue fleece for TK years, since she was 18 -- likes it. “We still do oceanography the old fashioned way,” Straneo said. “You kind of have to do everything yourself.”</p>
      <p>The Jensen had taken a back route, through narrow channels, from the port of Tasilaaq in southeastern Greenland to Sermilik Fjord. Peaks towered on both shores. A thin fog filtered cathedral light onto glass-still water. To the west, the ice
        sheet itself bulked vast and gray behind the peaks. Icebergs, most calved by Helheim, were constant companions--some white, some sparkling blue, some sooty black--often dwarfing the Jensen as it steered around them like a tugboat around an
        oil tanker. Every so often, the quiet was broken by the waterfall rush of violence, as icebergs flipped over, agitated by the ship’s wake.</p>
      <p>Beyond collecting and placing long-term moorings, the team wanted to measure the salinity and temperature of the water column within the fjord, as far north as the ice would allow. The work has its hazards: one year, the ice was so thick on
        the way to retrieve a mooring that the captain had a panic attack and turned back. A few days later, it turned out, an iceberg destroyed that mooring. But Straneo was confident that the old icebreaker was up to the task.</p>
      <p class="p-short-spacing">There was some frustration, however, after her efforts to retrieve the first mooring ended in failure. But three others came back with little drama, their spherical red-and-white floats popping up near the ship. Each
        mooring monitored a different depth to capture the Arctic-fed water near the surface and the Atlantic layers beneath it. “It looks so easy when they come up,” Straneo said. “And it’s so painful when they don’t.”</p>

      <p>After several days in Sermilik’s midsection, the Jensen steamed closer to Helheim. The icebergs and their detritus grew denser, until the fjord seemed more ice than water. A mate climbed to the crow’s nest to spot hazards, and the Jensen
        began plowing through human-sized bergs to avoid their larger cousins. Finally the ice defeated us. Helheim’s cliff face, some 25 kilometers away, loomed into view for a few minutes before a fairy-castle iceberg obscured it.</p>
      <p>It was a fairly close approach for Straneo, but it still left a large gap in her data. But there would be other opportunities to fill it. He collaborators would be launching long-lived drifters that can navigate beneath sea ice. And, after
        the cruise, Straneo’s team planned to take a helicopter out to the polynya and drop sensors straight into the plume of meltwater. </p>
      <p>Even as the Jensen navigated the fjord,two teams were monitoring the glacier itself. Near its front, Finnegan and the CRREL scientists tended to the autonomous Atlas lasers, one mounted on each side of fjord. They had also agreed to help
        Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a glacial seismologist at Pennsylvania State University, deploy 14 small seismometers, called geopebbles, on the glacier just behind the calving front—a feat possible only from the air.</p>
      <p>After a career working in Antarctica, it was Anandakrishnan’s first experiment in Greenland. In the helicopter, his eyes went wide when he saw the glacier. This was nothing like the flat, solid marine glaciers in Antarctica. Helheim was
        gouged with crevasses some 20 to 30 meters deep; its southern flank was such a crumpled mess that it was difficult to tell where the glacier stopped and sea ice began. “It’s so spectacular,” he said. “It’s so scary.”</p>
      <p>Over and over that day, the helicopter pilot hovered centimeters above the cracked ice. Two tethered CRREL researchers hopped out. They drilled a hole, dropped in a geopebble handed to them by Anandakrishnan, and marked it with an orange
        flag. The devices would capture the seismic signals that shudder through the ice as it fractures—data that Anandakrishnan hoped to assemble into a three-dimensional image of the under-ice channels that carry meltwater from its surface to the
        sea. The water “collects just like any river into larger and larger streams,” he said, “until you have the, you know, the Nile running down the bottom of Helheim.” </p>
      <p>First, Anandakrishnan needed to see if his geopebbles worked. They were designed to transmit data wirelessly, so that a hovering drone could harvest the data. Two days after inserting the instruments, he and Marc Volpe, a gangly
        aerospace-engineering student, took their homegrown drone out for a test flight. It looked the part. Two plastic pipes with a rotor on either end were strapped to a central metal axis about the length of a hockey stick. The landing gear were
        made of styrofoam. </p>
      <p>The first few short test flights, launched from as close to the glacier as they could safely go,<YES?> ended in crashes. That prompted “an unintended rapid reconfiguration,” Volpe said. The drone’s simplicity meant it could be rebuilt, and
          by late morning of their second day, they were ready to send it out over the ice. “All clear,” Anandakrishnan said. “No children or polar bears.” But after skimming
          <?> more than a kilometer over Helheim, the drone began spinning like a drunk, and they nearly lost it before the radio signal returned and they called it back.</p>
      <p>Finally, the day waning, Anandakrishnan asked Volpe if he wanted to try again. “It’s not your drone, it’s not your money,” Anandakrishnan said. “Want to go for it?”

      </p>
      <p>“Yeah, I think so,” Volpe said.</p>
      <p>The drone again started flying sideways — but in the right direction. A kilometer passed. Two. “Come on!” Anandakrishnan yelled. Three kilometers. “Holy crap it’s there!” Volpe said. The drone hovered for a minute over the seismometer, then darted back toward home. “Did it connect to the pebble?” Volpe asked. Not only did it connect, Anandakrishnan said with glee, “We got a big chunk of data.”</p>

      <p>Housed in a conical gray turret on a fjord wall, an unending mass of granite and moss, one Atlas scanner was watching the ice sheet decay. Below it lay the camp that has been the CRREL team’s summer home for the past half-decade. A nearby waterfall provides drinking water, no filtration needed. A slanted granite slab offers dinnertime views of the sun setting over Helheim. </p>
      <p>The team there felt Hamilton’s absence keenly. “Gordon would have never allowed this,” Finnegan said as he poured hot water into baggies of freeze-dried food. “He believed in a good meal after a hard, long day of field work.” The void was even more pronounced this year: Stearns, Gordon’s<?>
          former student and successor, was on maternity leave.</p>
      <p>One morning, the CRREL team clambered up a cliff to the nearby Atlas laser. Adam LeWinter, a CRREL geoscientist, gave it a friendly twist to say hello. It whirred into to its rest position, gears growling at the interruption. The researchers
        cleaned, greased, and calibrated it while downloading data. They replaced a weather station and updated the batteries. Two reinforced vertical solar panels bracketed the device, and several weather-protected black cubes contained
        methanol-powered fuel cells for the long Arctic night. “The only fuel that doesn’t freeze,” Finnegan said. “But the exhaust does, which is problematic.”</p>

      <p>The dream of running Atlas year-round had proven elusive. During the summer, the two scanners work flawlessly, whirring to life every six hours. But each winter, they have found new ways to die. The team took bets on when the lasers would
        fail this winter. Ananda Fowler, a remote-sensing scientist at CRREL, raised eyebrows with her forecast: They’d survive. “It feels good, man,” he said. “I think this is the year.”</p>
      <p>The billions of data points, and counting, collected by the scanners have not proven easy to interpret. But the continuous measurements have revealed, for example, the extent to which sea ice dropped by Helheim inhibits subsequent calving
        and how crevasses open and spread. This summer, the lasers were trained on the polynya, tracking ripples to gauge the strength of the upwelling plume and watching the nearby ice to see if it was decaying faster than usual [[ok?]]. In the past
        few years, the glacier retreated so much that the scientists had to shift Atlas’s field of view by 15 degrees, so that it could still observe the receding ice face.</p>
      <p>Helheim was more active than the team could remember, cracking and grumbling. At the camp, heads popped up like prairie dogs each time a rumble and a whoosh signaled another collapse of ice into the polynya some 3 kilometers away. Within
        minutes, the force of the upwelling cleared the pool and stasis returned. </p>
      <p>One day, a red helicopter clattered into view. The Jensen had docked at Tasiilaq the previous day; now Straneo and others were collecting data from parts of the fjord that the ship could not reach. They hovered near the cliff face, a
        mosquito against the white wall, getting a close view of the polynya. Before they could sample, Helheim began grumbling, and the pilot shot away, landing at a safe difighstance on the sea ice. “I can’t believe we set down on that berg,” Jaime
        Holte, an oceanographer in Straneo’s lab, said later. They ultimately flew back to the polynya, and Helheim remained docile enough for Straneo to shoot a disposable probe into the water to measure temperature and salinity.</p>
      <p>Afterward, the helicopter landed at the camp. The polynya was astonishing, Straneo reported. “The warm water in the plume is all the way up to the surface.” Later, data collected by drifters showed that, for weeks, warm Atlantic waters had
        flowed 100 kilometers up the fjord, then welled up against Helheim’s face. “It confirms this upwelling is driven by the glacier,” Straneo said later, and appears to be playing a role in Helheim’s demise. </p>
      <p>“Ten years of work and this is what you get,” Straneo said later, staring at a record of water temperature and salinity on her laptop, her voice a mix of pride and bemusement.</p>
      <p>It was a hard-won victory after a disappointing end to their cruise. A second mooring, off the coast, hadn’t resurfaced. And an additional attempt to recover the first mooring had failed.

      </p>
      <p>A clearer picture of Helheim’s dynamics, and how they relate to larger oceanic trends, is beginning to emerge from all the trial and error. This past summer, for example, Straneo says the data suggest conditions were unusual compared to
        recent years. Water temperatures in the fjord were “quite a bit warmer”--some 0.2 degrees above their previous high. “The moorings agree that we had a ramping up.” A slightly warmer North Atlantic, it appeared, conspired with the a robust
        surface melt to intensify the plume at Helheim’s face, potentially increasing calving. </p>

      <p>In general, researchers have found that the warmth of the fjord’s deep water tracks larger North Atlantic temperature swings. That suggests that ocean measurements could serve as a rough predictor of glacier retreat. Straneo and Donald
        Slater, a glaciologist and postdoc in her lab, have already used a model based on that connection to predict that by 2100 a quarter of Greenland’s glaciers will retreat more than 10 kilometers, if emissions and ocean warming continue
        unchecked. </p>
      <p>But “We’re still far from being able to make reliable projections,” said Mathieu Morlighem, an ice-sheet modeler at the University of California, Irvine, who is also working on the Helheim project. “If we don’t get ice dynamics right at the
        coast, there’s no way we get a decent projection.”</p>
      <p>That will take further close scrutiny of Helheim. The lasers and replenished moorings will remain in place at least until 2022. And next year, the team will return with radar-equipped drones to map the hidden topography underneath Helheim,
        looking for hidden slopes that could slow its retreat. Farther inland, they will use satellite measurements and drill cores of compacted snow to study past and present snowfall and melt. </p>
      <p>The team will turn to computer modeling to unify all their observations: the seismic wiggles, the currents, the calving, the snowfall and ponding meltwater. Douglas Brinkerhoff, an ice-sheet modeler at the University of Montana, in Missoula,
        will write the code that pulls these observations together, adapting techniques from weather modeling to suck in data. Meanwhile, Morlighem will develop a high-resolution model to replicate just how multiple processes conspire to dismantle
        the glacier. </p>
      <p>“What I told Mathieu is, at the end, you need to be able to reproduce what Helheim has done,” Straneo said. “And if we can explain this glacier, we should be able to scale up our understanding of the physics to other systems.”</p>
      <p>After three days with one Atlas, Finnegan’s team moved to the opposite side of the fjord, to ready the second scanner for the winter. Then, a few days later, the scientists were gone, their instruments left behind. Greenland continued to
        crumble; it lost 329 billion tons of ice this year, a near record. </p>
      <p>For now, Helheim endures. The Atlas lasers are keeping watch as the days shorten, whirring and dancing their invisible lights across the ice. And, in the fjord, a lost mooring, holding fast to the murky bottom, records the signal of an
        ever-warming sea.</p>
